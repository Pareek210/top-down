## How the Internet Revolutionized the World

As a software engineer, the internet will be a key part of your daily work. You'll use the internet to learn, build, and share your work. It's important to understand the basics of the internet, including its history and how it works. This will help you navigate the vast amount of information available online and make sense of it all.

The internet has come a long way since its humble beginnings. It started as a way for researchers to share information, but has since grown into a global network that connects billions of people and devices. At its core, the internet is a network of networks, made up of servers, routers, and other hardware that work together to transfer data.

One of the key reasons for the internet's success is its ability to connect people and devices from all over the world. This has led to the development of new technologies and services, such as e-commerce, social media, and ride-sharing. It has also made it easier for people to access information and communicate with others.

Looking to the future, the internet is only going to continue to evolve and grow. New technologies, such as the internet of things and artificial intelligence, are set to change the way we live and work. As a software engineer, it's important to stay up-to-date with these developments and understand how they will impact your work.

### World Wide Web

The World Wide Web, or simply the web, is a vast network of interconnected documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs.  The web was created in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, while working at CERN. Since then, it has grown exponentially, becoming an essential part of our daily lives. It is the primary platform for information sharing, communication and collaboration on the internet, and has revolutionized the way we access, consume and share information.

To understand the web better, it is important to know the key concepts and technologies that make it work.

### Internet Browser

Web browsers are software applications that allow users to access and interact with the web. Some popular examples of web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. These browsers use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate with web servers and retrieve web pages, which are then displayed on the user's screen.

The history of web browsers is closely tied to the development of the web itself. Early browsers such as Mosaic and Netscape Navigator were limited in their capabilities, but as the web grew in popularity and complexity, so too did web browsers. Today, modern browsers are capable of rendering complex web pages, playing audio and video, and running web-based applications.
