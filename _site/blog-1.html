<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I graduated from one of the best computer science engineering schools in the world, where I had access to excellent professors, a talented peer group, and guidance from successful seniors. Despite these advantages, it can still be difficult to make the most of this education. Traditional teaching methods often focus on the details without providing a broader understanding of the field. Additionally, a lack of guidance and opportunities to engage with the real-world software development community can make it difficult for young students to develop a passion for the subject. This article is an attempt to provide a top-down view of software development for those new to the field. The goal is to help students understand the landscape and plan their own path with the right information and resources.</p>

<p>To avoid getting lost in the details, it’s important to keep the broader goals of your education in mind. Start with the following steps and supplement each with additional practice and information:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Gaining a basic understanding of computers</li>
  <li>The purpose of software development - how it creates value</li>
  <li>Getting familiar with the internet</li>
  <li>Critical parts of a software and the development lifecycle</li>
  <li>Taking the baby steps in programming</li>
  <li>Theoretical aspects of being a software developer</li>
  <li>Understanding the building blocks of code</li>
  <li>Continuous endeavour to strengthen math &amp; logic</li>
</ol>

<p>This is an evolving list, and each of these areas includes many sub-categories. It’s a good idea to regularly revisit these overarching goals and take a step back to assess your progress.</p>

<h2 id="fundamentals-of-software-development">Fundamentals of Software Development</h2>

<p>If we were to select a group of 100 first-year university students from any institution in the country, it’s likely that their familiarity with computers would vary greatly. While access to technology has improved in recent years, many people’s primary interaction with computers is still limited to their smartphones. They may also have a desktop or laptop for common tasks like writing documents, watching movies, browsing the web, and playing games. Few students come to university with a background in the inner workings of computers.</p>

<p>In this section, I don’t aim to reinvent the wheel, but rather to curate the excellent content that is already available. I will provide guidance and suggestions to help you navigate this material. As you learn, be sure to supplement your knowledge with your own research on YouTube and other sources. The key is to develop curiosity and explore new concepts. Over time, you should aim to identify your preferred sources of information and learning materials that suit your style.</p>

<h3 id="early-computing-machines">Early Computing Machines</h3>

<p>Early computing machines were mechanical or electro-mechanical devices that were used to perform calculations. One of the earliest computing machines was the abacus, which was used for basic arithmetic operations. The abacus is a frame with beads that can be moved along wires or rods to represent numbers and perform calculations.</p>

<p>As technology advanced, more complex computing machines were developed, such as the mechanical calculators that were used in the 19th and early 20th centuries. These machines were operated by turning a crank or pressing a button to perform calculations.</p>

<p>In the mid-20th century, electronic calculators were developed, which used electronic circuits and components to perform calculations. These machines were faster and more versatile than their mechanical predecessors, but they were still relatively limited in their capabilities.</p>

<p>In the 1950s, more powerful computers were developed, such as the UNIVAC and IBM 701, which used vacuum tubes and other early electronic components to perform complex calculations and store and manipulate data. These machines were the precursors to the modern computers that we use today.</p>

<h3 id="input-output-devices">Input-Output Devices</h3>

<p>Input-output devices are hardware components that are used to interact with a computer. Input devices allow a user to provide data or instructions to the computer, while output devices display or present the results of the computer’s processing.</p>

<p>Some common input devices include the keyboard, which is used to type text and numbers, and the mouse, which is used to move a cursor and select on-screen items. Other input devices include touchscreens, microphones, and cameras.</p>

<p>Output devices include the display screen, which is used to show text, images, and other information. Other output devices include speakers, which are used to produce sound, and printers, which are used to produce hard copies of documents.</p>

<p>Some input-output devices, such as a desktop computer, combine both input and output capabilities in one device. These devices often include a keyboard and a mouse for input, and a display screen and speakers for output.</p>

<p>Input-output devices can be thought of as the modern equivalent of older technology such as the typewriter, which was used for input, and the radio, which was used for output. Just as the typewriter allowed a user to input text and the radio allowed a user to hear sounds and music, modern input-output devices provide similar capabilities in a more versatile and efficient way.</p>

<h3 id="processors">Processors</h3>

<p>A computing processor, also known as a central processing unit (CPU), is the part of a computer that performs the instructions of a computer program. The CPU is the “brain” of the computer, and it is responsible for executing the instructions that make up a program.</p>

<p>The CPU is a complex piece of hardware that contains multiple components and circuits, such as the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), the control unit, and the registers. These components work together to fetch instructions from memory, decode and execute them, and store the results of the calculations.</p>

<p>The history and current state of computing processors is a fascinating and rapidly evolving field. To learn more about the history and current state of computing processors, you can read books and articles on the subject, watch videos and tutorials, or take online courses. Some resources you may find helpful include the following:</p>

<h3 id="computer-memory">Computer Memory</h3>

<p>Memory is a crucial component of a computer that is used to store data and instructions for use by the CPU. There are two main types of memory in a computer: primary memory, which is directly accessible by the CPU, and secondary memory, which is not directly accessible by the CPU but can be accessed slower than primary memory.</p>

<p>Primary memory, also known as random access memory (RAM), is a type of memory that is directly accessible by the CPU. It is used to store data and instructions that are currently being used or processed by the CPU. Primary memory is volatile, which means that it is erased when the power is turned off.</p>

<p>Secondary memory, also known as non-volatile memory, is a type of memory that is not directly accessible by the CPU. It is used to store data and instructions that are not currently being used by the CPU but are needed for future reference. Examples of secondary memory include hard disk drives (HDD), solid-state drives (SSD), and USB flash drives.</p>

<h3 id="operating-systems">Operating Systems</h3>

<p>A computer operating system (OS) is a software program that manages the hardware and software resources of a computer. The operating system is the most important software on a computer, as it provides the interface between the user and the computer hardware, and it enables applications and programs to run on the computer.</p>

<h3 id="low-level--high-level-languages">Low-level &amp; high-level languages</h3>

<p>Assembly language and machine language are low-level programming languages that are used to write programs that can be executed directly by a computer’s central processing unit (CPU). These languages are called low-level languages because they are close to the native language of the CPU, which is called machine code.</p>

<p>Assembly language is a symbolic representation of machine code that uses mnemonic codes to represent the instructions of a computer program. These mnemonic codes are easier for humans to read and write than the binary machine code, but they are still very close to the machine code and require a deep understanding of the CPU’s architecture and instruction set.</p>

<p>Machine language, also known as machine code, is the native language of the CPU. It is a sequence of binary digits (0s and 1s) that represent the instructions of a computer program. Machine language is not human-readable and is difficult to write, but it is the most efficient and direct way to communicate with the CPU.</p>

<h3 id="assemblers-compilers--program-execution">Assemblers, Compilers &amp; program execution</h3>

<p>A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code that can be executed by a computer’s central processing unit (CPU). The source code is the human-readable code that is written by a programmer using a high-level programming language, such as C++, Java, or Python. The machine code is the native language of the CPU, which is a sequence of binary digits (0s and 1s) that represent the instructions of a program.</p>

<p>An assembler is a program that translates assembly language code into machine code. Assembly language is a symbolic representation of machine code that uses mnemonic codes to represent the instructions of a computer program. These mnemonic codes are easier for humans to read and write than the binary machine code, but they are still very close to the machine code and require a deep understanding of the CPU’s architecture and instruction set.</p>

<p>Compilers and assemblers are essential tools for programming and are used in almost all software development processes. They enable programmers to write high-level source code that is easy to read and understand, and then translate it into machine code that can be executed by the CPU. Compilers and assemblers are complex programs that perform many tasks and require a deep understanding of computer architecture and programming languages.</p>
