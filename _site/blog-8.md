## Strengthening Math & Logic for Programming

Computers, at their core, are machines that execute simple 0-1 instructions. All complex software can be reduced to a set of instructions in a defined order. As a beginner programmer, it's important to have the ability to break down complex operations into simple, logical steps. In today's complex world, processing large amounts of data, considering multiple perspectives, and generating valuable insights is a crucial skill for your career.

The earliest computers were primarily used for complex calculations, but today, a wide range of real-world applications, such as the way Google provides search results, Facebook protects passwords, Netflix recommends movies, and Uber finds cabs, make use of simple mathematical concepts. Many careers in information technology today require only a fraction of the math usually taught in college, but to reach your full potential, it's important to have a strong foundation in math.

Logical thinking, while rooted in mathematics, is a skill that can be honed on its own. You don't need a formal education in logic, but you do need to practice thinking logically and algorithmically to be successful in your career. Processing problems and situations quickly is a valuable life skill.

As a student of computer science, it's important to continuously improve your mathematical and logical skills. While there's no set path to improve in these areas, you can develop interests and habits that incorporate math and logic into your daily life. This can be done through activities such as - 

1. Solving logical puzzles and playing mathematical/card games
2. Practicing algorithmic thinking and implementation
3. Learning the basics of statistics & data analysis
4. Participating in competitive programming
